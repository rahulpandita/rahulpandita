### Hi there üëã

I am Rahul Pandita, a _Staff Researcher_ at [Github](https://next.github.com/).

My primary research interests are in data science and automated software engineering. I specifically work in the area of program comprehension targeted towards improving developer/tester/end-user productivity.


Previously, I worked as a _Senior Research Scientist II_ at [Phase Change Software](https://phasechange.ai/).
Before that, I was as a postdoctoral researcher at [Department of Computer Science NCSU](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) working with [Dr. Laurie Williams](http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/) and [Dr. Munindar Singh](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/mpsingh/).
I received my [PhD.](rahulpandita.github.io/files/diploma.pdf) from [NCSU](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) in Computer Science.
And I believe that ‚ÄúThere is so much more left to be done...‚Äù. 
I strongly believe that there is always room for improvement ...
